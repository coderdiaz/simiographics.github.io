            I'm a user interface designer focusing principally on user experience for digital products/services as well as web development. I was born in Michoacán, México and after living in various cities around the country, I've since established myself in the beautiful metropolis of México City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I've ventured into entrepreneurship with <a href="http://www.lingbry.com/" title="Lingbry" target="_blank">Lingbry</a>, a platform that seeks to make language teaching and learning easier by connecting people with independent teachers around the world. It's been a huge learning experience for me so far, as I have taken on multiple roles such as designing the entire platform, including the user experience as well as the frontend and backend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also had the opportunity to get involved with the Open Government movement by joining the <a href="http://mxabierto.org/" title="México Abierto" target="_blank">México Abierto</a> team as a frontend developer, in wich I worked on a couple of projects such as <a href="http://datos.gob.mx/" title="Datos.gob.mx" target="_blank">datos.gob.mx</a>, México's official platform for releasing open data to the public and <a href="http://www.gob.mx/participa" title="gob.mx/participa" target="_blank">gob.mx/participa</a>, a tool for allowing citizen participation and collaboration for the betterment of public policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've developed valuable skills in design and coding by forming part of several talented teams, such as:
